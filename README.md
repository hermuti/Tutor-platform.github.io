so far this is what i was working on

Local Development with Django and Git

1. Set up a virtual environment
   i have created and activated a virtual environment (env) to isolate my Python/Django dependencies.

2. Installed Django
   i installed Django inside the virtual environment so the project has access to it.

3. Ran migrations
   i ran python manage.makemigration and python manage.py migrate to apply Djangoâ€™s default database setup (like tables for users, sessions, etc.) into your SQL database.

4. Created a superuser (optional if already done)
   This gave me access to the Django admin panel.

5. Started the server
   i used python manage.py runserver to start the Django development server and test the app locally in the browser.
   which works perfectly
